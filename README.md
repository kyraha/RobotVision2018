Robot vision experiments for FRC Power Up game of 2018

## powerup-led
This is a hello-world type of program. Its directory is an Eclipse/C++ project.
But basically it's just one cpp file with main() function in it so can be compiled
in any environment. It requires OpenCV dev packages.

To run powerup-led you'll need a 1280x720 image and a camera intrinsics yaml file.
